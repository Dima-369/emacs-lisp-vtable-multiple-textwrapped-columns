# emacs-lisp-vtable-multiple-textwrapped-columns

The idea was to use `vtable.el` to display multiple textwrapped columns which easily works using Python to wrap the content nicely.

Right now, highlighting ``` blocks is unsupported though and there are many other TODOs to make this work as nicely.

Plus one needs dynamic resizing based on window width.
